                <li>“The RingJect is great. Being pre-loaded is the major advantage because it saves time and confusion in the OR. The leading portion of the CTR (ski-tip) helps reduce the risk of the ring catching the weak capsular bag, and the flexibility of the ring allows for a soft implantation.”

                <li>“I use Ophtec CTRs regularly on my premium lens cases, CTRs allow for short and long term rotational stability for toric IOLs, and positional stability for presbyopic IOLs. Furthermore CTRs give extra assurance in the rare instance a toric IOL has to be adjusted or presbyopic IOL needs to be
                    exchanged. For these reasons, I have never regretted a prophylactic placement of a CTR.”

                <li>“Positioning of multifocal IOLs is
                    important as a tilt or decentration
                    can degrade the quality of vision and
                    produce photic phenomena, causing subjective symptoms
                    and decreased patient satisfaction. Perfect centration of
                    multifocal IOLs is crucial to their optimum optical functioning
                    and to preventing problems related to decentration and tilt,
                    especially night-vision complaints. Capsular tension rings
                    were developed to stabilize the capsular bag.
                    They have been shown to inhibit posterior capsule
                    opacification, may play a role in the stability and positioning
                    of multifocal IOLs, and may prevent IOL rotation caused by
                    capsular bag contraction, thus providing good centration.
                    The more complex the optics, the greater the need for perfect
                    IOL positioning and centration, which the use of a CTR may help
                    achieve. And some studies show that CTR can help achieve a
                    postoperative refraction close the planned refraction without
                    the need to augment the planned postoperative refraction.
                    This supports the hypothesis that the CTR plays a role in
                    stabilizing the IOL and improving outcomes.
                    Ophtec CTR provides an easy self-loading for the surgeon’s
                    convenience. The unique feature associated with the
                    Rinject product is the proprietary manufacturing process
                    used to manufacture each Ringject capsular tension ring
                    - compression moulding. This process provides a tension
                    ring with total flexibility which ensures that each ring can be
                    manipulated during surgery without the fear of snapping,
                    unlike most other tension rings which can be brittle and can
                    snap when inserted under stress. And we can easily control
                    the speed and the action/retraction of the CTR injection. Also,
                    it’s very convenient in case of deep set eyes because it has
                    long small tip.”

        <li>Prof Sunil Shah
            <ul>
                <li>“I use CTRs routinely for my premium IOL
                patients as I believe this ensures good
                centration and prevents late movement
                from capsule contraction. In the rare occurrence that the lens
                needs to be explanted, it also facilitates surgery as the bag
                opens up very easily.
                I prefer Ophtec CTR because they are preloaded, relatively
                pliable out of injector so they insert without any additional
                tension on bag and they unhook without manipulation. Hence
                they add no significant time on for the surgical procedure”

        <li>Prof. J.L. Alió
            <ul>
                <li>“I routinely use CTRs in my premium IOL,
                    cataract and lens surgery. The reasons
                    for this are 4:
                    1. Better outcomes
                    We have been able to demonstrate in two different intraocular
                    lenses (Acrylisa Zeiss and Mplus Oculentis), that the use of a
                    CTR creates a better outcome for far and near vision. These
                    results are related to the better performance of multifocal
                    intraocular lenses as the lens is better placed in the eye.
                    2. More stable IOL, less induction of aberrations
                    IOL malpositioning is one of the reasons for dysphotopsia
                    related problems. On clinical observation at the slit lamp, small
                    tilts or decentrations cannot be easily observed especially in
                    refractive optics such as the Mplus. In these cases, the CTR
                    makes the lens exactly placed in the frontal plane avoiding
                    the induction of position induced aberrations and subjective
                    symptoms.
                    3. Explanting and substituting IOL in the bag
                    A second chance for the patient is that you are unlucky
                    and the patient is unable to tolerate the multifocal image
                    (failure of neuroadaptation), something that happens
                    seldomly today but still has to be considered, to explant the
                    IOL and substitute it with a monofocal lens is feasible with
                    a CTR even after 2 or 3 years, as in my experience. However,
                    without a CTR, to reopen a capsular bag and to explant the
                    lens, especially a plate haptic one, is associated the major
                    complications, visual loss and can compromise the future of
                    the eye.
                    4. Delayed posterior capsule opacity
                    The use of CTRs has been associated to delayed PCO. PCO
                    is one of the main reasons for light scattering and when it
                    happens it very early and negatively affects the outcome of
                    the multifocal IOL. Such a delay is very much welcome in these
                    cases.
                    For all these reasons, I strongly recommend the use of CTR
                    in every premium intraocular lens. It might be possible that
                    every IOL, multifocal or not, should benefit from a CTR implant
                    but definitely our premium patients will find a much better
                    outcome and a much better future in case of optical related
                    complications if they have a CTR implanted jointly with the
                    premium IOL.”
